The project is developed using Django, with a focus on creating a robust, scalable, and secure system. Initially, the project setup includes creating a Django environment and configuring a MySQL database to manage menu and reservation data. The project then integrates the Django REST Framework (DRF) to build API endpoints for CRUD operations on the menu and reservations. Authentication is handled using Djoser, and the API is thoroughly tested with Insomnia and Django’s testing framework to ensure reliability and security.",

        "Spring Security showcases the implementation of a robust user authentication system using Spring Boot, focusing on secure user signup, login, and email verification processes. Key features include user registration with an integrated email verification flow, where a verification code is sent to the user's email and validated before account activation. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated to ensure secure communication in subsequent requests. The project also includes endpoints to fetch authenticated user details and implements basic error handling and exception logging to enhance the application's reliability and maintainability.",

        "This is a stock price predictor using historical data of the S&P 500 index. The project leverages Python's yfinance library to fetch historical stock data and uses the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The primary goal is to predict whether the S&P 500's closing price will increase the next day. The data is prepared by calculating rolling averages and trends over different time horizons. A Random Forest Classifier from the scikit-learn library is employed to create a model that predicts the market trend. The performance of the model is evaluated using precision scores, and the results are visualized to understand its effectiveness.",
